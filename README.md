## Personal Screen Saver Creator v1\.0


</div>

### Description

This is a pretty cool program that I made that allows you to create custom

screen savers. It's not just a screen saver example - but a screen saver

creator! Add your own picture(s) or message and choose from a variety of

effects! You could also learn a lot from this because it's commented and the

coding is simple. This took me a few days to make so I hope you like it!

Please vote if you find it useful or you learn something! Email all

questions or comments to me at: AedSeeD@aol.com. Thanks! (O:
